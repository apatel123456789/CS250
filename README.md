#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs' express people's goals, values and aspirations. They are the things people need from a product or service to do something. User needs help us to express and understand who our users are, and the circumstances which lead them to use a product or service. Once you understand what the user needs are, you should try to express them as user stories. User stories describe a user and the reason they need to use the service you’re building.
User stories help me to track everything I need to do, think about my work from a user’s perspective, discuss my work with colleagues and priorities my work

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Find out what the problem is.
Find out who the stakeholders are.
Think about what resources and skills you have available.
Research which interventions are effective.
Choose your goal and how to measure it.
Identify which activities are likely to lead to the goal.
Create the documentation.
Though agile techniques may have originated as a way to better manage software development, some popular agile concepts are being used to help bring order, lower stress, and accomplish tasks in daily life.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Great teams communicate well. They keep people informed with the least amount of effort. Team members understand what they need to do and buy in to why they are doing it. These teams create open, safe environments where people feel comfortable sharing ideas and concerns.
